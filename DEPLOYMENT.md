# NOODEL Word Game - Railway Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Your project is now ready for Railway deployment! The following files have been added:

- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts
- `server.js` - Express server for static file serving
- `railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration
- `.gitignore` - Files to ignore in version control
- `README.md` - Project documentation

### 2. Deploy to Railway

   ```bash
   git add .

2. **Deploy on Railway**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "Start a New Project"
